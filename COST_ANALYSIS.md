## ðŸ“Š Recommendation Based on Cost:

### If you want ZERO ongoing costs:
**Choose Option 2** - Enhanced localStorage with export/import
- Users backup their own data

- Still professional experience
- Users own their data files

### If you're okay with small monthly costs:
**Choose Option 1** - Supabase auth

### Data Storage Size Estimate:
- Brand foundation: ~5KB per user

- Users control their data
- Still professional
- Can upgrade to cloud later if needed
