# User Authentication & Data Persistence Options

## Option 1: Quick Supabase Auth (Recommended)
- Email/password authentication
- All brand data synced to cloud
- Works across all devices
- Automatic backup and restore

## Option 2: Enhanced localStorage with Export/Import
- Keep current localStorage system
- Add robust export/import for brand foundations
- Users can manually backup their data
- Simpler implementation, no accounts needed

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Optional account creation
- localStorage as default
- Supabase sync for users who want it
- Best of both worlds

## Current Implementation Status:
✅ Brand foundation stored locally
✅ Content ideas saved locally  
✅ Calendar posts saved locally
✅ Settings stored locally
✅ Export/import for brand foundations

❌ No cross-device sync
❌ No user accounts
❌ Data lost if browser cleared
❌ No backup protection
